These Node.js scripts are the basis for creating a Discord Bot, I will constantly add more files with more actions for the bot to perform. These files that I will publish you can use them as you wish without any limit, I just ask you to follow me or leave a star.

If you want to recommend new features, open a Pull request: https://github.com/AtomixDem/DiscordBot.js/pulls

If you have problems with the bot, write on Issues: https://github.com/AtomixDem/DiscordBot.js/issues
